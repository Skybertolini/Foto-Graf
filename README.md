# Wedding Photography Portfolio

This is a simple, elegant website built to showcase some of my professional photography work.  
Most of the photos are from weddings, but you’ll also find a few personal projects and favorite moments.

## About the project
The site is designed to focus on light, emotion, and genuine human connection — with a clean layout that lets the images speak for themselves.  
It’s built as a static site and can be viewed directly through GitHub Pages.

## Technologies used
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- Lightweight and responsive layout
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
